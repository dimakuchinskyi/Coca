Processing is in real time, immediately after the user makes a request for the process to start, he expects a result. Another approach is to apply vertical scaling to AWS architecture. Meaning we used larger, more expensive instances that have more RAM and processing power. This system worked well for smaller datasets, maybe up to 5k entries, but for larger datasets multiple problems arose. This solution is prone to failure due to long request time. Also, because of some 3rd party services that aren't optimized for large scale loads or they don't have batch endpoints. 3rd party services also tend to protect their architecture from making a huge bill on their end. The whole process was done in real-time. The request can take a lot of time hanging in there while the backend would do all the work and return the result to the client. The request was limited to 300 seconds (at time of writing the article) before AWS would cancel it... Also I need to mention that the user has to wait a few minutes to see the results.

This third party is the key that we need to leverage on when\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  developing our solution. So here's how we did it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"detail-section-title\">Initial approach</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOur initial approach went like this: The web application would read a .csv file line-by-line and submit an array of entries to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbackend REST API. Processing is in real time, immediately after the user makes a request for the process to start, he expects a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresult. Another approach is to apply vertical scaling to AWS architecture. Meaning we used larger, more expensive instances that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave more RAM and processing power. This system worked well for smaller datasets, maybe up to 5k entries, but for larger datasets\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmultiple problems arose. This solution is prone to failure due to long request time. Also, because of some 3rd party services that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  aren't optimized for large scale loads or they don't have batch endpoints. 3rd party services also tend to protect their\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture from making a huge bill on their end. The whole process was done in real-time. The request can take a lot of time\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thanging in there while the backend would do all the work and return the result to the client. The request was limited to 300\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  seconds (at time of writing the article) before AWS would cancel it... Also I need to mention that the user has to wait a few\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  minutes to see the results. They can't use the app during the process, which makes for a bad user experience.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</article>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"detail-share\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"share-icons\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareFacebook} alt=\"Share on Facebook\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareTwitter} alt=\"Share on Twitter\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareLinkedin} alt=\"Share on LinkedIn\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span className=\"share-label\">Share this article</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"detail-author-card\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-card-left\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={authorAvatar} alt=\"Renee Wells\" className=\"author-avatar-large\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-card-right\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-top\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-name\">Renee Wells</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-role\">Product Designer, Quotient</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-share\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareFacebook} alt=\"Facebook\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareTwitter} alt=\"Twitter\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={shareLinkedin} alt=\"LinkedIn\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-written\">Written by</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"author-description\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSkilled in React Native, iOS and backend, Toni has a demonstrated knowledge of the information technology and services industry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith plenty of hands-on experience to back it up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</main>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<section className=\"detail-cta\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"detail-cta-inner\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"detail-cta-title\">Think beyond the wave</h2>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"detail-cta-desc\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk about Sans products, pricing, implementation, or anything else.
